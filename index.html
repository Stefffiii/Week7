<!doctype html> 
<!-- 
This is an HTML comment!
Any text that appears between these two tags does not affect the webpage in any way.  

The doctype tag above lets your browser know this is an html document, and should be the first line of any normal webpage.  It isn't required on CodePen (which may alert you), but can be left if you ever plan to copy this code into a live site.

The html used to build this page is called a "boilerplate".  Instead of having to type the standard tags (doctype, html, head, body) that all pages need, developers usually start with one of these.  The CodePen editor includes a fantastic tool called emmet, which makes writing html much faster and less prone to error by expanding shorthand notation.  This boilerplate is available through emmet by typing a ! in an html window and pressing TAB.  The boilerplate without my comments and content looks like this:

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>

Now, on to the page!
-->

<html lang="en"> 
<!-- The html tag wraps all of the content.-->

<head> 
<!-- The head tag doesn't show as part of the page, but contains the "title" of your website and information your computer might need to view the page correctly. --> 
  
  <meta charset="UTF-8" /> 
  <!-- A technical detail about how the text is saved digitally. -->
  
  <title>My ITIQ Website</title> 
  <!-- This title shows in the page's tab on your browser, and usually is the title Facebook, G+, and others use when sharing a page. -->

</head>
<!-- The head should be closed before opening the body. -->

<body>
<!-- The body of the page is what is actually displayed in the browser window. -->
  
  <h1>Hello class!</h1>
  <!-- h1, h2... are called header tags, with h1 being the most important header and h6 the least. -->
  
  <p>CodePen's excellent interface will let you edit any part of this Pen and see live updates in the window below.  While your changes aren't saved on my Pen, you can "fork" (as in fork in the road) this Pen and save it as your own!  We won't be using the CSS or JavaScript windows in this lesson, so you should collapse them with the checkbox in the top-right corner of each, to better view the HTML editor.</p>
  <!-- p tags are used to mark paragraphs.  While they don't indent by default, they include a small margin below. -->
  <p>Like any programming language, HTML can be frustrating to write.  Typos in the syntax can make a page display incorrectly, or maybe not at all.  Using the powerful emmet syntax in the CodePen editor, we can write HTML faster and make a lot fewer mistakes.  Check out the HTML comments to see how this page is based on the ! boilerplate.  To create any tag pair with emmet, type the tag's name (without brackets, e.g. p, strong, div) and press TAB.</p>
  <h4>SO MUCH BETTER, AMIRITE?</h4>
  <p>You will notice in the HTML window that these paragraphs do NOT have an extra space between them.  In fact, we could leave any number of blank lines between paragraphs and it would not alter the webpage in any way.  HTML ignores "newlines", also called carriage returns from typewriter days.  The extra space comes from the default styling that the browser applies to headers and paragraphs, which includes a small margin underneath.  This, and many other styles, can be changed using CSS (cascading style sheets).  We'll learn more about CSS in future Pens and in the next Module.</p>
  <p>Once you have looked over the HTML and played a little with the editor, go on to <a href="https://codepen.io/scotthorn/pen/AybjG">Part 2 (https://codepen.io/scotthorn/pen/AybjG)</a>.</p>
